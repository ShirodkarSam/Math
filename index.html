    Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, 
    shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are 
    represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry,
     and analysis, respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common 
    definition for their academic discipline. Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties 
    of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. These objects consist of either abstractions 
    from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called 
    axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results.
     These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some 
     basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.

    Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the 
    social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths 
    of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as 
    statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often
     grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application 
     (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications.
     The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical
      application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer 
      networks.

    Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek 
    mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided
     into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th
     centuries, when algebra[a] and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. Since then, the 
     interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep 
     increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of 
     mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in
      the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject 
      Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.

    During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly 
    speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields
     differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the 
     typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division 
     into four main areas–arithmetic, geometry, algebra, calculus–endured until the end of the 19th 
     century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, 
     but now are considered as belonging to physics. The subject of combinatorics has been studied for 
     much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth 
     century.

    At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization 
    of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics. The 2020 Mathematics 
    Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas. Some of these areas 
    correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher 
    arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have "geometry" in their names or are otherwise 
    commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are 
    respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century
     or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.
